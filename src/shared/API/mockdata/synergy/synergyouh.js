      <b>What is the purpose of the study?</b>
      <p>
      The aim of this study is to understand how your everyday physical activity is related to mobility and physical capacity.
      Information about your daily activity may reflect your general health status and may allow doctors who are responsible
      for your care to have a more detailed view of how you feel, during your daily life.
      <br>
      Many health issues, like heart diseases and frailty, can limit physical mobility. Doctors often use standard physical
      tests, like walking for 6 minutes or standing up and walking, to see how healthy someone is overall. Using wearable
      devices and smartphone can help collect objective measurements about our daily movements, however, these devices
      haven't been proven to be helpful for doctors yet. Understanding how to connect the data from these devices with
      the results from the tests doctors trust could help us understand the meaning and relevance of those data for our
      health. At the same time, we have to consider how usable these technologies are and if people accept using them.

      </p>

      <b>Why have I been invited?</b>
      <p>
      You are asked to participate in this research since, having received a Fontan procedure,
      you have a partial mobility limitation and therefore you could very well benefit from this technology.
      We intend to recruit 35 people like you.
      </p>

      <b>Do I have to take part?</b>
      <p>
      No. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You can decline to participate,
      and you can withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason. Withdrawal will not affect clinical care.
      </p>

      <b>What will happen to me if I decide to take part?</b>
      <p>
      Participation in this study requires 1 visit with the research team, in which you will be asked to perform
      two simple physical tests, the six-minute walk test (6MWT) and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, while wearing
      a medical device (G-Walk) to correctly quantify your movement. . The team will give you a fitness tracker
      and explain you how to use it, and will help you install the Mobistudy app on your smartphone. At the end
      of the baseline visit you will be encouraged to answer a first questionnaire through the app.
      <br>
      After the first visit, at home and for the duration of 2 months, you will asked to wear a fitness tracker
      (MiBand 3) for as much time as possible during your daily life and to use the Mobistudy app to synchronise
      the data from the tracker. Every week, the app will ask you to complete one 6MWT, which you will do outdoor
      when the weather allows, guided by the phone. The app will remind you when the test is due and will show you
      instructions about how to do it. During week 5 and 9 after the start of the study you will be asked to answer
      questionnaires about the use of the app. You may be asked to use a distance measuring wheel (trundle wheel)
      when doing your 6MWT, so that we can compare its measurement with the one estimated by the app.
      At the end of the 2 months period, you will return the devices to the researchers and you will also be asked
      to perform a final supervised 6MWT. In addition, you will be invited to participate in an interview and a group
      discussion to investigate your opinion about the use of this technology. With your permission, the interview
      may be recorded and we may use direct quotes from the recordings.
      You will also receive a short report about your collected data. The report will include the results obtained from
      the app and the activity data, such as the number of steps and average heart rate values. It is important to state
      that the provided information is not medical.

      </p>

      <b>What should I consider?</b>
      <p>
      Your current care and daily life should not be altered by the study. You should not participate in the
      study if you are aware of being pregnant or if your physical conditions make it impossible or risky
       to walk for about 6 minutes. Participation in other studies is not a hindrance.
      </p>

      <b>Are there any possible disadvantages or risks from taking part?</b>
      <p>
      There are no major risks associated with participating in this study, provided that you can walk safely
      for more than six minutes. If you are not feeling well before or during the test you should stop the test
      and wait until you are feeling better.
      By sending the data collected during your weekly tests, the Mobistudy app will produce some additional traffic
    on your mobile phone which, depending on the type of connection and the mobile Internet contract you have, may
    generate some additional costs. Nonetheless, we estimate these costs to be much smaller than the ones generated, for example, when using common social networks or watching online videos.
      When personal and health-related data are stored, there is always the possibility that data is leaked unlawfully.
      All the systems used in this study employ state-of-the-art security mechanisms such as encryption and strict
      access control rules, therefore we consider this risk to be very small.
      </p>

      <b>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</b>
      <p>
      During follow-up visits with your doctor, you can bring and discuss a report of your study data.
      These discussions are not part of the study and will not be recorded or registered, however, if
      they bring useful information, they may become the basis for a new research study.
      <br>
      We hope that this research will allow, in the future, patients to share data they collect about their
      daily activity through smartphones and wearable devices with clinicians so that these data can be used
      for diagnosis and improving treatments. This is, however, a long-term ambition and you should not expect
      any immediate consequence from participating in this study.
      <br>
      The results of the study will be published in scientific outlets. If interested, you can contact the researchers
      who will be very happy to share information about these publications with you
      </p>

      <b>Will my General Practitioner/family doctor (GP) be informed of my participation?</b>
      <p>
      Your GP will not be informed, as the study will not affect clinical care.
      </p>

      <b>Will my taking part in the study be kept confidential?</b>
      <p>
      Your answers and your data will be processed so that unauthorised persons cannot access them.
      Confidential information collected by the team at the hospital will be stored on a secured
      computer managed by the researchers. Data collected by the Mobistudy app will be stored on a
      secure system managed by Malmö University, in Sweden. All collected data will be analysed by
      researchers at both institutions.
      <br>
      In order to allow other researchers to use the collected data and improve the science that it
      supports, we plan to make the data anonymous and share them on research data websites. The
      anonymization process will remove any potentially identifiable information such as names, date of
      birth, geographical information and absolute timestamps. If you wish to opt out from sharing the
      anonymized data, please inform the research team.
      Responsible members of the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust may be given access to
      data for monitoring and/or audit of the study to ensure that the research is complying with
      applicable regulations.
      </p>

       <b>Will I be reimbursed for taking part?</b>
      <p>
      You will have to cover expenses to travel to the clinic and parking by yourself for the two in-clinic visits.
      In addition, you will have to cover costs associated with the transmission of the data using your mobile
      phone, which should be negligible compared with the amount of data that is commonly transmitted using,
      for example, social media. Other than the previously mentioned items, the study does not involve any other cost.
      </p>

      <b>What will happen if I don't want to carry on with the study?</b>
      <p>
      Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You can decline to participate and you can withdraw
      from the study at any time. Your withdrawal will have no effect on your care.
      You can withdraw from the study by accessing the “studies” section of the Mobistudy app. The data you have produced
      so far within the study will be kept, but if you want them to be removed contact the research team.
      You can remove your account from Mobistudy by accessing the “profile” section of this app. This will remove all
      your data collected by Mobistudy except the technical logs, which will be deleted after 1 year.
      <br>
      Be aware that after the anonymised dataset has been released, we may not be able to remove your data from it,
      especially if other researchers are already using the dataset.
      </p>

      <b>What will happen to the results of this study?</b>
      <p>
      We will analyse the collected data and write the results of our analysis on papers and reports to be published on scientific journals or to be presented at scientific conferences.
      No personal information will be disclosed on those publications.
      The results may also be used to help students to complete their master or doctoral studies.
      We will compile a short report about the data you will have collected in this study and send it to you over email.
      During follow-up visits with your doctor, you can bring and discuss a report of your study data.
      These discussions are not part of the study.
      </p>

      <b>What if there is a problem?</b>
      <p>
      As in healthcare in general, you are covered by the Patient Insurance.
      Please remember that there are no special compensation arrangements in this study, but the Oxford University
       Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust will provide indemnity if needed. If you are harmed due to someone's negligence,
       then you may have grounds for legal action but you may have to pay for it.
       NHS bodies are legally liable for the negligent acts and omissions of their employees.
        If you are harmed whilst taking part in a clinical trial as a result of negligence on the part of
        a member of the study team this liability cover would apply. Non-negligent harm is not covered by the
        NHS indemnity scheme. The Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, therefore, cannot agree in advance to pay compensation in these circumstances. In exceptional circumstances, an ex-gratia payment may be offered.The Patient Advisory Liaison Service (PALS) is a confidential NHS service that can provide you with support for any complaints or queries you may have regarding the care you receive as an NHS patient. PALS is unable to provide information about this research study.
      If you wish to contact the PALS team please contact Tel: 01865 221473 Email: PALS@ouh.nhs.uk.
