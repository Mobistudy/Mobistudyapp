    The Mobistudy app is meant to be used by citizens who want to contribute to
    research studies using their mobile phones.
    In order to use the app you will need to create an account on the Mobistudy
    server. This profile is needed regardless of whether you join a
    research study or not. The profile requires the following information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your email address.
      This is needed to identify you, allow you to login, and to recover your password.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your name and surname.
      These may be needed to personalise messages sent to you or in those studies
      where it will be necessary to identify each participant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your date of birth.
      This is needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your sex.
      This is also needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any long term conditions, like asthma or diabetes.
      This is needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any medication that you take regularly, for example insulin.
      This is needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In addition to the data contained in this profile, the app will share information about your 
    participation to research studies with the Mobistudy server, like the date and time you 
    joined or withdrew from a study, or the date and time of the activities you performed within 
    a study. These are needed to keep track of your participation in existing studies and
    avoid inviting you to studies you are already taking part in, or studies that are not suitable
    to be part of at the same time.

    These data are securely transferred (via HTTPS) and stored on a server
    hosted and managed by the University of Malmö, Sweden. Data is encrypted on 
    both the app and the server and during transmission (via https). Personnel 
    from the University of Malmö may access the server and your data for 
    technical maintenance, but will not analyse any of these data, unless
    they are part of the research study you have decided to participate in.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you decide to join a research study, you may be required to share your data
    with the institutions involved in the study, but further study-specific
    conditions will apply, which will be clearly shown to you and you will be allowed
    to accept or reject.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under no circumstances other than the ones specified above, will your data be
    shared with other parties or individuals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your data are kept on the server for as long as you decide to keep your profile on
    Mobistudy. Study specific-data will be kept for the duration of study, which
    is going to be specified when you join a study. The app allows you to delete your 
    account and any data associated with it at any time, by tapping a button.
  </p>
  <p>
    The server will register the date and time you login or send data and
    the IP address from which the data comes from. These technical logs are needed 
    to allow for security audits and will be kept for 5 years in all circumstances, 
    even if you decide to delete your account.
