    The Mobistudy platform is meant to be used by citizens who want to contribute to research studies using their mobile
    phones. The platform is managed by Malmö University, in Sweden.
  </p>

  <p>
    To use the app, you will need to create an account on the Mobistudy platform, which will be shared with Malmö
    University. This profile is needed regardless of whether you join a research study or not. The profile requires the
    following information:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Your email address. This is needed to identify you, allow you to login, and to recover your password.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your name and surname. These are needed to personalise messages sent to you or in those studies where it is
      necessary to identify each participant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your date of birth. This is needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your sex. This is also needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any long-term health conditions you might have, like asthma or diabetes. This is needed to match your profile
      with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any medication that you take regularly, for example insulin. This is needed to match your profile with the
      inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your height and weight. These are needed to match inclusion criteria and to configure some of the activities you
      can perform using the app.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In addition to the data contained in this profile, the app will collect and share information about your
    participation in research studies with Malmö University, like the date and time you joined or withdrew from a study,
    or the date and time of the activities you performed within a study. These are needed to keep track of your
    participation in existing studies and avoid inviting you to studies you have already taken part in, or studies that
    are not suitable to be part of simultaneously.
  </p>

  <p>

    study, including:

    The purpose and extent of data collection within each study will depend on the study itself. A further
    study-specific privacy policy will be clearly shown to you before joining the study and you will be allowed to
    accept it or reject it.
  </p>

  <p>
    All the collected data are securely transferred and stored on a server hosted and managed by Malmö University,
    Sweden. Data is encrypted on both the app and the server and during transmission. Personnel from Malmö University
    may access the server and your data for technical maintenance, but will not process any of these data for clinical
    or research purposes, unless they are collected within the context of the research studies you have decided to
    participate in. Malmö University may publish general statistics about the number of users registered on the
    platform, their country of residence and age group.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under no circumstances other than the ones specified above, will your data be shared with other parties or
    individuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your data are kept on the server for as long as you decide to keep your profile on Mobistudy. Study-specific data
    will be kept for the duration of study, which is going to be specified when you join a study. The app allows you to
    delete your account and any data associated with it at any time, by tapping a button, however, some data may be
    retained because it may be legally or practically impossible to delete them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The server will also record technical logs containing the date and time you send or request data and the IP address
    from which the data comes from, but not the data associated with the request. These technical logs are needed for
    security audit and will be kept for 1 year in all circumstances, also if you decide to delete your account.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can download the data in a machine-readable format. Contact <a href="mailto:mobistudy{'@'}mau.se">mobistudy{'@'}mau.se</a>
     if you need to do this.

    The consent can be revoked at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:mobistudy{'@'}mau.se">mobistudy{'@'}mau.se</a> and

    previous consent will be erased. The same address applies if you would like to find out what has been registered
    about you or if you would like to have errors corrected, information erased or processing restricted. Be aware that
    different conditions may apply for data collected within a research study, according to the privacy policy
    of the study.
